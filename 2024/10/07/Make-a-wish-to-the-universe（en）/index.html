<p>Author Hayami reflects on the possible “big tech company syndrome” within herself. In reality, many things are not as complicated as they seem. Often, simply taking action can quickly solve problems, and it’s best to use the simplest methods possible. Seeking help from those around you is not shameful.</p>
<p>1. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The girl said, “First, you need to enjoy yourself, and then you’ll attract people with the same energy. When you’re happy, good things will naturally follow, and money will come eventually.”</p>
<p>“How did you meet x?” — “They reached out when they were doing their RV media project. The RV thing didn’t work out, but we got to know each other.” “How did you find sponsors?” — “Oh, how? Just posting on social media is enough.”</p>
<p>I asked a few more questions. I realized that when I ask, I’m always very cautious and hesitant because some things seem incredible and difficult to me. But when she answers, it’s always matter-of-fact and straightforward, like “Oh, isn’t it just like this or that?” She said, “Make a wish to the universe. Just as some people will pay for your sandwich, some will support your ideas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The washing machine at the Mosuo People’s Museum broke down.</p>
<p>The girl suddenly said, “Oh! Let’s crowdfund a washing machine.”</p>
<p>Without seeking opinions from those around her, she quickly drafted a message, created a group chat, and posted on her social media, simultaneously sharing it in the museum’s community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crowdfunding a washing machine for the Mosuo People’s Museum ▪️Target amount: 1500 ▪️Donate as you wish Will be donated to the Mosuo Museum in everyone’s name Will publish the entire donation process You can send it directly to me Thank you all Please share Love you~</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within ten minutes, 30 people gathered in the group, each transferring 100 or 200 yuan. They quickly exceeded the donation target. Originally, they only needed 1000 yuan, but in just one short afternoon, they raised 4000, and the amount was still increasing. After posting, the girl was very confident that they would raise the money. She told someone nearby, “Great! You’re in charge of buying the washing machine, I’ll transfer the money to you.” Then she went to work by Lugu Lake, not particularly worried about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suddenly realized, this is also a kind of “big tech company syndrome”!</p>
<p>In a big tech company, to do something, you need to go through long-term value justification, multi-party involvement, extensive lobbying, designing a perfect plan, and breaking down the workload meticulously. Only when everything is ready and all aspects considered can you proceed. Furthermore, if such elaborate efforts are required for a small task, people can easily be alienated into machines without independent consciousness. It’s like living in a society full of fatigue; even if you realize something is wrong, you just accept it passively. Negative, passive, listless.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like it’s becoming harder for me to send out signals and change the energy around me. Cynically shrinking into my shell, losing confidence and interest in actively influencing my surroundings. But after countless “Oh, you can do it like that?” moments of realization, I feel the need to make some changes. Make a casual wish to the universe, and let others help you fulfill it earnestly!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some things may seem difficult, but when you actually do them, you’ll find they’re easier than imagined.</p>
